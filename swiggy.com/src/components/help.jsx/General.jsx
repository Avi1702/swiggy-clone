                  We value our customerâ€™s time and hence moved away from a
                  single customer care number to a comprehensive chat-based
                  support system for quick and easy resolution. You no longer
                  have to go through the maze of an IVRS call support. Just
                  search for your issue in the help section on this page and
                  initiate a chat with us. A customer care executive will be
                  assigned to you shortly. You can also email us your issue on
                  support@swiggy.in. <br /> Note: We value your privacy and your
                  information is safe with us. Please do not reveal any personal
